# The ArviZ project
ArviZ is an open source project aiming to provide tools for Exploratory
Analysis of Bayesian Models that do not depend on the inference library
used. ArviZ brings together people from several probabilistic programming
libraries and from multiple programming languages. ArviZ will always be
free for everyone to use and released under the Apache License (Version 2.0).

The ArviZ team work in the open on [GitHub](https://github.com/arviz-devs)
with the input of the whole community and consensus of its core contributors.
