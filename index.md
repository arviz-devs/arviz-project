# The ArviZ project
ArviZ is an open source project aiming to provide tools for Exploratory
Analysis of Bayesian Models that do not depend on the inference library
used. ArviZ brings together people from several probabilistic programming
libraries and from multiple programming languages. ArviZ will always be
