"The ArviZ Project (The Project) is an open source software project "
"affiliated with the 501c3 NumFOCUS Foundation. The goal of The Project is to"
" develop open source software and deploy open and public websites and "
"services for reproducible, exploratory and interactive computing. The "
"Software developed by The Project is released under OSI approved open source"
" licenses, developed openly and hosted in public GitHub repositories under "
"the [arviz-devs GitHub organization](https://github.com/arviz-devs). "
"Examples of Project Software include the code of the two ArviZ libraries and"
" their Documentation, etc. The Services run by the Project consist of public"
" websites and web-services that are hosted at [https://arviz-"
"devs.github.io/](https://arviz-devs.github.io/) The Project is developed by "
"a team of distributed developers, called Contributors. Contributors are "
"individuals who have contributed code, documentation, designs or other work "
"to one or more Project repositories. Anyone can be a Contributor. "
"Contributors can be affiliated with any legal entity or none. Contributors "
"participate in the project by submitting, reviewing and discussing GitHub "
"Pull Requests and Issues and participating in open and public Project "
"discussions on GitHub, Slack, and Gitter chat rooms. The foundation of "
"Project participation is openness and transparency."

"Traditionally, project leadership was unstructured but primarily driven by a"
" subset of Core Contributors whose active and consistent contributions have "
"been recognized by their receiving “commit rights” to the Project GitHub "
"repositories. In general all Project decisions are made through consensus "
"among the Core Contributors with input from the Community."

"While this approach has served us well, as the Project grows and faces more "
"legal and financial decisions and interacts with other institutions, we see "
"a need for a more formal governance model. Moving forward The Project "
"leadership will consist of a Random Variables Council. We view this "
"governance model as the formalization of what we are already doing, rather "
"than a change in direction."
