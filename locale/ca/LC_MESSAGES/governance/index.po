"have been recognized by their receiving “commit rights” to the Project "

"While this approach served us well, as the Project grew and faced more "
"legal and financial decisions and interacted with other institutions, we "
"saw a need for a more formal governance model. We also wanted to prevent "
"falling prey to the [tyranny of "
"structurelessness](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm). Since "
"2020, The Project leadership consists of a Random Variables Council. We "
"view this governance model as the formalization of what we are already "
"doing, rather than a change in direction."
