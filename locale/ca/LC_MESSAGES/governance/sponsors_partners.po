"The Random Variables Council are the primary leadership for the project. No "
"outside institution, individual or legal entity has the ability to own, "

"Institutions become eligible to become an Institutional Partner by employing"
" individuals who actively contribute to The Project as part of their "
"official duties. To state this another way, the only way for a Partner to "
"influence the project is by actively contributing to the open development of"
" the project, in equal terms to any other member of the community of "
"Contributors and Council Members. Merely using Project Software in "
"institutional context does not allow an entity to become an Institutional "
"Partner. Financial gifts do not enable an entity to become an Institutional "
"Partner, to be recognized for financial gifts see {ref}`gov_sponsors`. Once "
"an institution becomes eligible for Institutional Partnership, the RV "
"Council must nominate and approve the Partnership."

"An Institutional Partner is free to pursue funding for their work on The "
"Project through any legal means. This could involve a non-profit "
"organization raising money from private foundations and donors or a for-"
"profit company building proprietary products and services that leverage "
"Project Software and Services. Funding acquired by Institutional Partners to"
" work on The Project is called Institutional Funding. However, no funding "
"obtained by an Institutional Partner can override the RV Council. If a "
"Partner has funding to do ArviZ work and the Council decides to not pursue "
"that work as a project, the Partner is free to pursue it on their own. "
"However in this situation, that part of the Partner’s work will not be under"
" the ArviZ umbrella and cannot use the Project trademarks in a way that "
"suggests a formal relationship."
