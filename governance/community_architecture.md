# Community Architecture

* General Contributors
* {ref}`core_contributor_description` (of which Council members are also a part of)
* 7 Person steering council ({ref}`council_description`)

Anyone working with ArviZ has the responsibility to personally uphold
the Code of Conduct. Core Contributors have the additional responsibility
of _enforcing_ the Code of Conduct to maintain a safe community.

(core_contributor_description)=
## Core Contributors
Core Contributors are those who have provided consistent and meaningful contributions to ArviZ.
These can be, but are not limited to, code contributions, community contributions, tutorial
development etc. Core Contributors will be given the ability to manage the ArviZ GitHub
repository, including code merges to main. This does not necessarily mean Core Contributors
must submit code, but more so signifies trust with the project as a whole.

The process for new people to join the project as core contributors is
described at {ref}`contributor_onboarding`

### Core Contributor Responsibilities
* Enforce code of conduct
* Maintain a check against Council

### Current Core Contributors
Current core contributors are listed {ref}`on this page <core_contributor_list>`

(council_description)=
## Random Variables Council
The Project will have a Steering Council that consists of Core Contributors
who have produced contributions that are substantial in quality and quantity,
and sustained over at least one year. The overall role of the Council is to
ensure, taking input from the Community, the
long-term well-being of the project, both technically and as a community.

During the everyday project activities, council members participate in all
discussions, code review and other project activities as peers with all other
Contributors and the Community. In these everyday activities, Council Members
do not have any special power or privilege through their membership on the
Council. However, it is expected that because of the quality and quantity of
their contributions and their expert knowledge of the Project Software and
Services that Council Members will provide useful guidance, both technical and
in terms of project direction, to potentially less experienced contributors.

### Council Responsibilities
Council Members will have the responsibility of
* Removing members, including Council Members, if they are in violation of the Code of Conduct
* Making decisions when regular community discussion does not produce consensus on an issue
  in a reasonable time frame. See {ref}`council_decision_process` page for more details.
* Making decisions about strategic collaborations with other organizations or individuals.
* Making decisions about the overall scope, vision and direction of the project.
* Developing funding sources
* Deciding how to disburse funds with consultation from Core Contributors

The council may choose to delegate these responsibilities to sub-committees. If so, Council members must update this document to make the delegation clear.

:::{important}
Individual council members do not have the power to unilaterally wield these
responsibilities. The council as a whole must jointly make these decisions.
In other words, Council Members are first and foremost Core Contributors, but only
when needed they can collectively make decisions for the health of the project.
:::

### Length of Tenure and Reverification
* Council members term limits are 4 years, after which point their seat will come up for reelection.
* Each year on April 7th council members will be asked to restate their commitment to being on the council
* Attempts should be made to reach every council member over at least 2 communication media. For example: email, Slack, phone, or GitHub.
* If a council member does not restate their commitment their seat will be vacated.
* Inactivity can be determined by lack of substantial contribution, including votes on council, code or discussion contributions, contributions in the community or otherwise.
* In the event of a vacancy in the council, an {ref}`election <council_selection>` will be held to fill the position.
* There is no limit on the number of terms a Council Member can serve
