I'd like to nominate NAME or @HANDLE to be a TYPE contributor at ArviZ.

Following our [governance doc](https://www.arviz.org/en/latest/governance/processes.html#new-contributor-nominations-and-confirmation-process),
the next step is for you  to accept the nomination which you can do commenting on this issue.
If you accept the nomination, there will be a [council vote](https://www.arviz.org/en/latest/governance/processes.html#voting-process)
(in private) and we'll publish the result here.

<!-- keep or delete this part below -->
In case it helps or you are still wondering, `arviz.org` has a description of the

role.
