I'd like to nominate NAME or @HANDLE to be a TYPE contributor at ArviZ.

To NAME or @HANDLE:

Following our [governance doc](https://www.arviz.org/en/latest/governance/processes.html#new-contributor-nominations-and-confirmation-process), the next step is for you  to accept the nomination which you can do commenting on this issue. If you accept the nomination, there will be a [council vote](https://www.arviz.org/en/latest/governance/processes.html#voting-process) (in private) and we'll publish the result here.

In case it helps or you are still wondering, `arviz.org` has a description of the
