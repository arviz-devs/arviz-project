## Summary of process
This is the 2nd election to happen for the ArviZ project.
The election process should now be stabilized and described
at {ref}`council_selection`.

## Process details
### Nominations for the RV Council (April 12th)
A GitHub issue within the [arviz-project](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz-project)
repository has been created for nominations to take place: 

### First round election (TBD)
Around April 26th (and no earlier than that) nominations will close and
the {ref}`first round of the election <initial_voting_election>` will start.

### Tie breaking election (if necessary) (TBD)
If necessary, a {ref}`tie breaking election <run_off_election>` will be held after the initial one.

### Election result (TBD)
Once the whole process ends, election results will be posted on the
same GitHub issue used for nominations and registered here too.
